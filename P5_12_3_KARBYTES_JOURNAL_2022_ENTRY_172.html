<p>This morning I left my sleeping bag under the tree where I was resting with the intent of coming back to retrieve it after charging my laptop computer at my mom&#8217;s house and drinking some coffee. As soon as I arrived, I saw my dad sitting in his car parked in my mom&#8217;s driveway smoking a cigarette and waving at me. As soon as I walked inside my dad walked in and stood there watching me make coffee while I pretended not to feel annoyed that he was watching me so intently and in a way which made me feel harassed. After he left, I drank some coffee, ate some dry cereal from the cabinets which tends to make my crotch smell like the sickly sweet cardboard flavor of that cereal, and installed some software updates on my Android phone while letting my laptop charge. I also browsed the Internet for a while and even had a chance to feel pleasantly entertained for a few minutes. After I smoked some weed using the new butane lighter I bought last night from a Cox gasoline station from the nice old lady who works as a cashier there, <span style="background:#ffff00;">I decided to return the petroleum powered car I have been borrowing to my mom.</span> I did not want to deal with the &#8220;chaos&#8221; which comes from having to depend on something so expensive, fragile, and prone to disasters. I feared that someone would eventually tamper with that vehicle such that I am forced to call a towing company or else report the car stolen. I also want to avoid getting into a car accident due to having to drive around so many reckless, impatient drivers in a crowded place. Once I drove that car back to my mom&#8217;s house, I went to the place at Horsey Hill where I left my sleeping bag to find that someone stole it. I felt very attacked at that point because I was thinking about how little other people support my conviction to live car-free and to invest in greener and more liberating commute methods. I drove the car to my dad&#8217;s house to switch my small backpack with my big orange backpack. I put the only backup sleeping bag I have (which is tattered with stuffing falling out) into my bag. I also made sure my birth certificate, steel toed work shoes, and interview outfit (a white shirt with long sleeves, a color, and buttons and black loose fitting nylon pants which looks like the prototype to a tuxedo) were in that backpack. A large orange poncho is stuffed into the top component of the backpack and I strapped my tent to the bottom of the backpack. The mesh of the water holders on the sides are broken. Hence, I put my two water bottles into my backpack. Then I drove the car back to my mom&#8217;s house and hope to never drive it again nor rely on it for any purpose (including storing my belongings). I put the large heavy backpack on and started walking down the streets watching petroleum powered cars drive past me and park on the street in front of me while the driver sat there and waited for me to pass him. I think that people want me to feel immobile, ostracized, and demonized for not driving a car but I feel strongly that one of my biggest obligations is to refrain from driving a petroleum powered car (especially since I seem to have more time, physical fitness, and better survival skills than most people). As I write this some people on the street are harassing me and insinuating that I waste my time walking too much and carrying too much stuff with me and that I will not make it in this world unless I resume driving a car and not being so fitness oriented. <span style="background:#ffff00;">I suppose such people are conditioned by &#8220;the matrix&#8221; to avoid discussing and thinking about environmental issues because it goes against their habitual dependence on fossil fuels combustion.</span> &#8220;No car, no life&#8221; and &#8220;Gasoline fuels our world&#8221; might as well be their mantras.</p>
<p>Anyway, I can now say that I have everything I need on my back to get a warehouse job (and to camp in the rain). I hope that my stuff does not get stolen or damaged before I have the means to replace that stuff with my own income earned from working. (It sucks that my parents do not want to invest in me getting a bicycle because I know a bicycle is the most cost effective and morally sound commute option. <span style="background:#ffff00;">A bicycle would save me hours of commute time and exposure to harmful pollution, radiation, and harassment from people without having to output any pollution</span>).</p>
<p>Also, I am headed to Dublin and plan to spend most of my time there while unemployed and on my weekends because that place has the amenities I need within a comfortable range and without as many bullies. I feel more welcome and respected in Dublin/Pleasanton than I do in Castro Valley. People in Castro Valley have been shockingly unkind to me.</p>
