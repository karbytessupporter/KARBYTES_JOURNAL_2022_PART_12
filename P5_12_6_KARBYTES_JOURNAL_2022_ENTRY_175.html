<p>Good news! I found my sleeping bag. It was under the tree where I left it folded up as I left it. <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_172/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">During the day</a> when I thought someone stole my sleeping bag (and I was very sad because that is like stealing a beloved blanket from a young child), I was looking under the wrong tree. There is a cluster of oak trees which I have not explored much (even though I feel as though I memorized every square centimeter of Horsey Hill&#8217;s topography over the past twenty plus years) and am hence not very familiar with. I am very glad to know that no one wanted to deprive me of that blanket and the incomparable peace and comfort of Horsey Hill.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was thinking about how some parts of the world (including my country (i.e. the United States of America)) have criminalized homelessness. Merely for living outside instead of in an apartment or house, a person could be incarcerated. Perhaps that is to force every person to pay rent and to prevent people from &#8220;freeloading&#8221; and from being unsightly, distracting burdens to other people who simply want to enjoy the public space without having to be reminded that there is a person not paying rent clogging up the space other people help pay taxes to maintain (because, if a person pays money to rent a home, that person is presumed to have some kind of taxable income in the form of a job (unless that person is classified as having a disability which allows that person to basically live on a fixed income provided by other people&#8217;s tax dollars). If no human worked, then there would presumably be no tax dollars available to provide a fixed income to the disabled (but robots might end up being able to pay for most if not all taxes by replacing human employees at essential jobs where humans were traditionally employed such as driving taxis, sorting mail, and planting and harvesting crops).</p>
<p>Suppose a person is thrown in jail for the crime of not paying rent. How long would that person be incarcerated? Well, as long as that person is incarcerated, that person would still be legally entitled to receive basic necessities such as food, medical care, showers, and basic housing (which presumably costs money). Just by being in prison, a prisoner is essentially &#8220;freeloading&#8221; off of the tax dollars used to pay for those prisons. Perhaps the prisoner should be kept in jail until that prisoner agrees to get a suitable job and follows through on getting that job. Then, once that prisoner appears to be willing and able to hold down that job, that person would be released from prison provided that the person be housed at a low-income housing unit using the paychecks earned from working to pay for rent of that housing unit. As long as the prisoner refuses to get a job, then that person will be treated as &#8220;disabled&#8221; and forced to live in a low income payed for by tax dollars while confined to the prison (which is designed to make that prisoner feel deprived of freedom, fun, and other coveted commodities).</p>
<p>Suppose no one wanted to work and everyone turned into farmers living outside. I suppose that such a populace would earn its right to exist that way because such a community would be self sustaining and not require tax dollars to support any of its members. I suppose the farmers would have to be their own police force and medical responders as well. It would be a closed system where physical goods and services are provided without using money as a medium of exchange. It would likely be a system of trust (i.e. each person doing its best to help itself and others to make good use of the resources so that everyone gets their basic needs met and no one is deprived). It would be like a herd of elephants living in the wild taking care of each newborn human as an automatically welcomed member of the tribe instead of some &#8220;illegitimate child&#8221; to be exiled. (Or course, the people &#8220;should&#8221; limit their reproductive rate so as to not disrupt the delicate balance of demand and supply of finite physical commodities).</p>
<p>These are just some late night thoughts to stow away to (perhaps) revisit some other time. Well, good night!</p>
